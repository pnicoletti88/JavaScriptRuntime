# JavaScriptRuntime

Fun project to write a simple javascript style runtime

Supported Features:
- Variable decleration: Number, String, Boolean and Undefined data type currently supported. Declare variable with "let".
- Variable reassignment: Variables do not have a type and can hold anytype of data
- Mathematical operations: +, -, *, / for numbers and + for strings
- Boolean operations: <, <=, ==, !=, >=, > for numbers. ==, != for strings. ==, !=, &&, || for booleans
- For Loops: simple for loop fully supported

Features To Be Completed:
- While loops
- Functions (call stack to be created - will support recursion)
- Conditionals (if, elif, else)
- setTimeout (non-blockingwith event queue and callbacks)

Most likely no other features beyond this will be implemented. Goal of project is to learn more about threading while implementing the non-blocking nature of javascript.
